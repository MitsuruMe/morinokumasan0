The other day,
I met a bear,
A great big bear,
A way up there.


He looked at me,
I looked at him,
He sized up me,
I sized up him.


He says to me,
"Why don't you run?"
"'Cause I can see,
you have no gun."


I say to him,
"That's a good idea."
"Now let's get going,
get me out of here!"


I began to run,
away from there,
But right behind me
was that bear.



And on the path
ahead of me,
I saw a tree,
Oh glory be.


The lowest branch
was ten feet up,
I'd have to jump
and trust to luck.



And so I jumped
into the air,
But that branch
away up there.


Now don't you fret,
and don't you frown,
I caught that branch
on the way back down.



That's all there is,
there ain't no more,
Unless I meet
that bear once more
